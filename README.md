In this Python program, I implement my own random number generator using the linear congruent method.

I then test my random-number generator with a series of parameters.

Finally, I determine the near-neighbor correlation in my random sequence by taking sums of products for small k, to see if my generator really does produce independent random numbers, which it does.
